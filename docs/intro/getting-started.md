# Getting Started with the Platform

This guide will help you get started with the Educational AI & Humanoid Robotics Platform. By the end of this guide, you will understand how to navigate the textbook, interact with AI agents, and use the simulation environment.

## Navigating the Textbook

The textbook is organized into several key areas:

- **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Learn about the Robot Operating System 2 architecture
- **Vision-Language Models**: Explore how AI perception works in robotics
- **Simulation Environments**: Understand how to work with different simulators
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Dive into the specifics of humanoid robot design and control
- **Exercises**: Practice what you've learned with hands-on exercises
- **Projects**: Build complete robotics applications

Each section contains interactive content, diagrams, and examples that you can experiment with using the platform's tools.

## Interacting with AI Agents

The platform provides specialized AI agents for different aspects of robotics:

### Selecting an Agent
To interact with a specific agent, use the agent selector in the chat interface. The available agents include:

- **ROS 2 Specialist**: For questions about ROS 2 architecture, communication, and best practices
- **VLM Specialist**: For questions about Vision-Language Models in robotics
- **Simulation Specialist**: For questions about simulation environments
- **Control Systems Specialist**: For questions about humanoid robot control

### Asking Questions
When asking questions, be as specific as possible. For example:

- ❌ "Tell me about ROS"
- ✅ "Explain how ROS 2 topics work in a humanoid robot"

## Using the Simulation Environment

The simulation environment allows you to test robotics concepts without physical hardware. You can:

1. Load different scenes
2. Spawn robots
3. Control robot behavior
4. Conduct experiments safely

### Basic Simulation Workflow
1. Navigate to the Simulation tab
2. Select and load a scene
3. Spawn a robot
4. Send commands to control the robot
5. Observe the results

## Practical Exercise

Try this simple exercise to get familiar with the platform:

1. Go to the chat interface
2. Select the "ROS 2 Specialist" agent
3. Ask: "What is the difference between ROS 1 and ROS 2?"
4. Review the response and sources
5. Try asking follow-up questions about specific ROS 2 concepts

## Next Steps

After completing this introduction:

1. Read about [ROS 2 Fundamentals](/docs/ros/fundamentals) to understand the core concepts
2. Explore the [Vision-Language Models](/docs/vlm/introduction) section to learn about AI perception
3. Try using the simulation environment with the provided tutorials
4. Complete the exercises in the [Exercises](/docs/exercises/chapter1) section
