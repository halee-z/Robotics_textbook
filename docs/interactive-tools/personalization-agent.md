# Personalization Agent

The Personalization Agent is an AI-powered tool that customizes textbook content to match each learner's individual needs, preferences, and goals.

## Overview

The Personalization Agent enhances the learning experience by:

- Adapting content complexity based on the user's knowledge level
- Highlighting topics relevant to the user's interests
- Focusing on learning objectives aligned with the user's goals
- Adjusting presentation style to match the user's learning preferences
- Providing a more engaging and effective learning experience

## How It Works

The Personalization Agent uses advanced algorithms to:

1. **Analyze User Preferences**: Collects information about the user's knowledge level, interests, learning goals, and preferred learning style.
2. **Process Content**: Takes the original textbook content and modifies it based on the user's profile.
3. **Generate Personalized Content**: Creates a customized version of the chapter that is more relevant and accessible to the individual learner.
4. **Adapt Over Time**: Learns from user interactions to continuously improve personalization.

## Features

### Knowledge Level Adjustment

- **Beginner**: Simplifies complex concepts, adds more explanations and foundational context
- **Intermediate**: Maintains core content with moderate depth and technical detail
- **Advanced**: Adds deeper technical insights, research perspectives, and advanced applications

### Interest-Based Customization

The agent can highlight or expand on topics relevant to specific interests such as:

- ROS 2 Development
- Vision-Language Models
- Humanoid Locomotion
- Human-Robot Interaction
- Simulation Environments
- Robot Control Systems

### Goal-Oriented Content

Content is tailored based on learning goals:

- **Understand Fundamentals**: Focuses on core concepts and principles
