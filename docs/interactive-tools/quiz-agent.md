# Interactive Quiz Agent

The Interactive Quiz Agent is an AI-powered tool designed to enhance your learning experience by providing personalized quizzes specifically based on the content of this textbook on AI and humanoid robotics.

## Overview

The Quiz Agent is an intelligent system that:

- Generates quizzes for any subject (Python, Math, AI, English, Robotics, etc.)
- Supports multiple question types:
  - Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
  - True/False questions
  - Short answer questions
- Adapts difficulty based on user performance
- Provides immediate feedback after each question
- Tracks scores throughout the quiz
- Provides final summary with strengths, weaknesses, and improvement tips

## How It Works

The Quiz Agent uses advanced AI to create a personalized learning experience. It dynamically adjusts the difficulty of questions based on your responses, ensuring that you are appropriately challenged as you progress through the quiz.

### Question Types

1. **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)**
   - Choose the correct answer from a list of options
   - Ideal for testing conceptual understanding

2. **True/False Questions**
   - Evaluate whether a given statement is true or false
   - Great for testing facts and principles

3. **Short Answer Questions**
   - Type your response to open-ended questions
   - Best for testing deeper understanding and application

### Adaptive Difficulty

The Quiz Agent continuously assesses your performance and adjusts the difficulty of questions accordingly. If you're answering questions correctly, the system will gradually increase the difficulty. Conversely, if you're struggling, the system will provide easier questions to help build your confidence.

## Using the Quiz Agent

To start using the Quiz Agent:

1. Navigate to the Quiz Agent interface
2. Select your preferred subject area (e.g., ROS 2, Vision-Language Models, Humanoid Kinematics)
3. Choose your difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
4. Begin the quiz and respond to questions as they appear
5. Receive immediate feedback and explanations after each answer
6. Review your overall performance at the end of the quiz

## Benefits

- **Personalized Learning**: Tailored to your current knowledge level
- **Immediate Feedback**: Learn from mistakes right away
- **Engagement**: Interactive format keeps you actively participating
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your improvement over time
- **Flexible Topics**: Quiz on any subject relevant to robotics and AI

## Implementation

The Quiz Agent is built with modern web technologies and AI integration, providing a responsive and intelligent learning experience. It can be integrated directly into this textbook or accessed as a standalone application.

## Example Quiz Session

```
Quiz Agent: "Welcome to the Quiz Agent! 🎯
Which subject and difficulty level would you like your quiz on?"

User: "ROS 2 Fundamentals, Intermediate"

Quiz Agent: "Great! Here's your first question:
In ROS 2, what is the purpose of a 'launch file'?
A) To compile source code
B) To start multiple nodes with a single command
C) To debug runtime errors
D) To visualize robot data"

User: "B"

Quiz Agent: "Correct! Launch files allow you to start multiple nodes with a single command, making it easier to manage complex systems."
```

## Getting Started

To add the Quiz Agent to your learning workflow, simply navigate to the Quiz Agent section and select your preferred topic. The system will guide you through the rest of the process.
