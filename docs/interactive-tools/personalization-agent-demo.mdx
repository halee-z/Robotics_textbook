  chapterContent="This is a sample chapter about ROS 2 fundamentals. ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to support the building of complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms. ROS 2 addresses the limitations of ROS 1, such as security, real-time support, and multi-robot systems. Key concepts include nodes, topics, services, actions, and parameters. The architecture is built on DDS (Data Distribution Service) which provides the underlying communication layer."
